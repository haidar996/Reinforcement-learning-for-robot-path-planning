# Reinforcement-learning-for-robot-path-planning
This project implements and compares multiple reinforcement learning algorithms for multi-robot path planning in grid-based environments with obstacles. The system enables robots to navigate from start positions to goal positions while avoiding collisions and obstacles using various RL approaches.
